## Tapioca Loca - A Restaurant Ordering App

Tapioca Loca is a minimalist single-page app that allows restaurant clients to order from a restaurant's website. Afterwards, the client will receive a confirmation text to inform them of when it will be ready. 

Tapioca Loca was built using HTML, CSS, JS, JQuery, AJAX, and PostgreSQL.
